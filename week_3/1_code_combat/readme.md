# U1.W3: Code Combat's Beginner Campaign


## Learning Objectives
1. Manipulate an object using JavaScript
2. Explain what `()` does in JavaScript
3. Use error messages correct syntax mistakes


## Directions
Visit [Code Combat](http://codecombat.com/play) and complete each of the missions in the beginner campaign using the steps below. These directions might seem tedious for something so simple, but it's important to get in the habit of going through these steps.  


Write pseudocode and an initial solution for each mission in your `my_solution.js` file. Please write the title of each mission (as a comment) as you go. 
 
###1. Pseudocode 
Write simple pseudocode for each challenge. For example, write something like:

```javascript
// move right x2
// move up 1x
// ATTACK!
```  

###2. Initial Solution
Translate your pseudocode into code and see if it achieves the goals. If it doesn't quite work, modify it. Once you achieve each of the goals in each part, paste your successful code into your file. 

###3. Answer the following:
When you are finished with all of the levels, answer the following questions. You may want to look at some resources on JavaScript before answering.
  - What is `this` referring to? Think programming-wise rather than in the terms of the game. 

‘this’ is an object in this case. It is referring to Tharin, the warrior we control and manipulate to create certain actions. So, Tharin is our object.


  - What does the `()` do in JavaScript?
	
	() contains an optional list of parameters that will be available for use in the function's body.
	Each parameter is a local variable that is available for use in the body of the function. 
	Ex. age
	function(age) {'List your age here:' age }; 
  	Now when you type function(22) the output is:
  	List your age here: 22

  - What is the point of the semicolons?
	
	The semicolons are important because once the code is parsed, it helps the computer understand where one statement ends and another begins.
	
## Reflect
In the reflection section of your 'my_solution.js` file, reflect on your learning. Use the [reflection guidelines](../reflection_guidelines.md).. ***NOTE: Reflections are mandatory!***
