# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?

The DOM is a tree like structure of the web page made up of parents and their children nodes. Having a structure that helps you identify different nodes of the page can be manipulated and used to make the webpage dynamic. So for example, you can write things like li:first in your css to refer to only the first list item.

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?

When I ran PageSpeed, my page came back with less things to fix in order to optimize performance (maybe it's because my page is more simple, but I think wordpress might slow down performance of your page since you are relying on a third party to aggregate the code pertaining to your site.)

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?

Certain parts were a bit painful, such as finding the css code pertaining to the exact html element. Although, learning about PageSpeed was very useful along with closure compiler to compile your javascript files.

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

I think PageSpeed was an "aha" moment because I never knew it existed. It can be very useful when you're trying to optimize the performance of your page (no one likes slow web pages!).

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
