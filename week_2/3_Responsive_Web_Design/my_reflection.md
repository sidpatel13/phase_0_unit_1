# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?

Today, people view web pages on many different devices such as desktop and laptop screens, tablets, and mobile phones. Each screen has a different size, which can be a challenge for web developers as they try to fit their product to each on of these different devices. Responsive design relies on relative widths and content and design driven media queries to ensure that web pages can scale to different devices.

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?

They have made content less cluttered. For example, when you're viewing web pages on your phone, you hopefully don't have a million little things thrown at you and instead the page is less cluttered. I think as we start developing software for other applications (ex. cars), we'll see even more simple intuitive web design.

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?

They view the web through screen readers, which take text and convert them to speech so they can hear what they would be viewing. We should design and develop for them especially ways to describe images, which can't be easily converted because they don't contain any text.

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?

Layouts, wireframes, semantic elements really make sense. I get media queries as well, but want some more practice with it.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
