# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0?
  
  I think it is doing things as quickly as possible. Sometimes I tend to spend a lot of time reading material and not       enough time working on the challenges. I sometimes can be reading one article and then start browsing through other       related articles and next thing I know a lot of time has gone by. Or sometimes I run into a problem and decide I'm going   to office hours to solve it, but put off going to office hours till the next day.

* How will you combat that?
  
  I think I'm going to aim to go to office hours at least twice a week. I also will spend more time working on challenges.   One thing I can do is time myself and give myself less time to do the readings. That way I'm forced to dive into the      challenges at an earlier time. If I run into trouble, I can always go back and read more. 



* What techniques will you try?
  
  I learned a lot of great things this week through the reading material. I think starting small is important. Being        focused for a full 25 min before taking a 5 min timed break is something I can do. I use toggl, so I can time how long I   spend on different activities. Telling my parents what I'll be working on in the morning and showing them my work in the   evening can also be a way to make sure I stay committed. If I don't spend enough time getting things done, at the end of   the day I feel terrible. I sometimes measure my happiness based on what I accomplished. I think this is something I have   to stop doing. I learned that measuring your self-worth based on how much time you spend on something is not the way to   do it. Also, give yourself less time to accomplish tasks, which can be a way to get more things done. If you give         yourself more time, you can sometimes spend more time goofing off and getting distracted.

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
  I try to spend everyday on a Phase 0 activity. Sometimes I find success, other times I can see myself getting             distracted and overwhelmed. I need to spend time doing other things I enjoy and giving myself less time to spend on       Phase 0. I know this sounds a bit counter-intuitive. But I think it can work. If I select 4 days a week and give          myself only 4 to 5 hours during those days to work on Phase 0, I feel I'll be more productive during that time. Also,     I'm going to start by doing the hard tasks at the beginning of the week. I sometimes spend the week learning and the      weekend building. I'm going to stop doing that. The week will be devoted to everything, no work on weekends.
