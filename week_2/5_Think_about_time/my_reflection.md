# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0?
  I think it is doing things as quickly as possible. Sometimes I tend to spend a lot of time reading material and not       enough time working on the challenges. I sometimes can be reading one article and then start browsing through other       related articles and next thing I know a lot of time has gone by. Or sometimes I run into a problem and decide I'm going   to office hours to solve it, but put off going to office hours till the next day.
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
